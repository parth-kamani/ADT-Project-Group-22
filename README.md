Description:

We have used the dataset available from “Walmart store forecasting”. In this dataset, we have weekly sales data for 45 stores and 99 departments for a period of 3 years. In addition, we had a store and geography-specific information such as store size, unemployment rate, temperature, promotional markdowns, etc. 

We are going to conduct multiline regression to predict the future (weekly) sales. As of now, we calculated the mean of weekly sales by department type, Weekly sales year-wise, correlation of weekly sales with other variables such as a store, dept., temperature, etc.
